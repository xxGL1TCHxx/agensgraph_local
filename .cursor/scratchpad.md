# AgensGraph Application Development Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested to build a full-stack graph database application using AgensGraph. This is a comprehensive project that includes:

- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, AgensGraph database integration, REST API, and WebSocket real-time capabilities
- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite, graph visualization using react-force-graph-2d, charts with Recharts, and Tailwind CSS styling
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose setup with AgensGraph database, AgensBrowser UI, and containerized services
- **Real-time Features**: Socket.IO for live data updates and graph visualization

The project follows a detailed development plan spanning 6 phases over 12-14 days, with clear deliverables and success criteria. The stack includes modern technologies and best practices for building a production-ready graph database application.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. **AgensGraph Integration**: Working with PostgreSQL + AGE extension requires specific Cypher query syntax
2. **Graph Visualization Performance**: Rendering large graphs with 1000+ nodes while maintaining responsiveness
3. **Real-time Data Synchronization**: Implementing WebSocket connections for live graph updates
4. **Docker Orchestration**: Setting up multi-service containerization with proper networking

### Implementation Approach
- Start with Docker infrastructure to ensure consistent development environment
- Build backend API first to establish data layer and validate AgensGraph connectivity
- Implement frontend incrementally with basic routing, then add visualization components
- Use TDD approach with tests written before implementation
- Focus on MVP features first, then add polish and advanced functionality

## Project Status Board

### Currently Working On
- **Task 8**: Initialize React project with Vite
- **Assigned to**: Executor
- **Expected Completion**: Today
- **Blockers**: None

### Completed Tasks
- ‚úÖ **Task 1**: Create project structure and directory layout
  - Created `api/` and `web/` directories
  - Set up `docker-compose.yml` with AgensGraph, AgensBrowser, API, and Web services
  - Added `.gitignore` files for both directories
  - Created comprehensive `README.md` with setup instructions

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Task 2**: Configure Docker Compose setup (Partially Complete)
  - Docker and Docker Compose installed successfully
  - Configuration syntax validated
  - ‚ùå Docker daemon connectivity issues prevent testing
  - Documented workaround approaches

- ‚úÖ **Task 4**: Set up Express.js API project
  - Initialized API project with pnpm and TypeScript
  - Installed dependencies: Express.js v4, pg, socket.io, dotenv
  - Created comprehensive server.ts with REST endpoints and WebSocket support
  - Implemented health checks, Cypher query helper, and CORS middleware
  - Server successfully starts on port 4000 with proper error handling

### Upcoming Tasks
- Docker Compose configuration
- Backend API setup
- Frontend React application initialization

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Docker Infrastructure Issue
**Issue**: Encountered persistent Docker daemon connectivity issues in the current environment
- Docker and Docker Compose are installed successfully
- Docker daemon fails to start properly (likely due to container environment limitations)
- Cannot connect to Docker socket even with sudo privileges

**Impact**: Cannot test Docker Compose configuration or start database services

**Suggested Path Forward**: 
1. Continue with application development (API and Web setup)
2. Create Dockerfiles and validate configuration syntax
3. Test Docker functionality in a different environment or use local development setup
4. Document alternative development approaches (direct PostgreSQL installation)

## Lessons

### User-Specified Lessons
- Include useful debugging info in program output
- Read files before editing them  
- Run `npm audit` if there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal
- Always ask before using the `-force` git command

### Project-Specific Lessons
- **Docker in Remote Environments**: Docker daemon may not start properly in containerized or restricted environments. Always validate Docker functionality early and have fallback development approaches
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: When Docker fails, continue with application development and test containerization in proper environments later
- **Express.js Import Issues**: Express v5 has module export issues with TypeScript. Use Express v4 for stability and CommonJS require() syntax for Express imports to avoid "is not a function" errors

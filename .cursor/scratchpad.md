# AgensGraph Application Development Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested to build a full-stack graph database application using AgensGraph. This is a comprehensive project that includes:

- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, AgensGraph database integration, REST API, and WebSocket real-time capabilities
- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite, graph visualization using react-force-graph-2d, charts with Recharts, and Tailwind CSS styling
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose setup with AgensGraph database, AgensBrowser UI, and containerized services
- **Real-time Features**: Socket.IO for live data updates and graph visualization

The project follows a detailed development plan spanning 6 phases over 12-14 days, with clear deliverables and success criteria. The stack includes modern technologies and best practices for building a production-ready graph database application.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. **AgensGraph Integration**: Working with PostgreSQL + AGE extension requires specific Cypher query syntax
2. **Graph Visualization Performance**: Rendering large graphs with 1000+ nodes while maintaining responsiveness
3. **Real-time Data Synchronization**: Implementing WebSocket connections for live graph updates
4. **Docker Orchestration**: Setting up multi-service containerization with proper networking

### Implementation Approach
- Start with Docker infrastructure to ensure consistent development environment
- Build backend API first to establish data layer and validate AgensGraph connectivity
- Implement frontend incrementally with basic routing, then add visualization components
- Use TDD approach with tests written before implementation
- Focus on MVP features first, then add polish and advanced functionality

## Project Status Board

### Currently Working On
- **Task 10**: Implement graph visualization
- **Assigned to**: Executor  
- **Expected Completion**: Today
- **Blockers**: None

### Completed Tasks
- ‚úÖ **Task 1**: Create project structure and directory layout
  - Created `api/` and `web/` directories
  - Set up `docker-compose.yml` with AgensGraph, API, and Web services
  - Added `.gitignore` files for both directories
  - Created comprehensive `README.md` with setup instructions

- ‚úÖ **Task 2**: Configure Docker Compose setup
  - Fixed Docker image compatibility issues (updated to bitnine/agensgraph:latest)
  - Resolved Tailwind CSS/PostCSS configuration issues in web container
  - Added proper .dockerignore files to exclude node_modules from build context
  - Fixed TypeScript build issues in API Dockerfile with proper clean/build steps
  - Added healthchecks and service dependencies for proper startup order
  - All services now running: Database (port 5432), API (port 4000), Web (port 5173)

- ‚úÖ **Task 4**: Set up Express.js API project
  - Initialized API project with pnpm and TypeScript
  - Installed dependencies: Express.js v4, pg, socket.io, dotenv
  - Created comprehensive server.ts with REST endpoints and WebSocket support
  - Implemented health checks, Cypher query helper, and CORS middleware
  - Server successfully starts on port 4000 with proper error handling

- ‚úÖ **Task 8**: Initialize React project with Vite
  - Created React 19 project with TypeScript and Vite
  - Installed core dependencies: wouter, TanStack Query, axios, socket.io-client
  - Added visualization libraries: react-force-graph-2d, recharts
  - Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Created routing structure with Home, Graph, and Charts pages
  - Development server successfully starts on port 5173

### Upcoming Tasks
- Graph visualization implementation
- Sample data creation and seeding
- Frontend-backend integration

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Infrastructure Success
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- All Docker containers are now building and running successfully
- API server is responding to health checks at http://localhost:4000/health
- Web frontend is accessible at http://localhost:5173
- Nginx is properly proxying API requests from web container to API container
- Database container is running AgensGraph (PostgreSQL + AGE extension)

**Key Fixes Applied**:
1. Updated AgensGraph Docker image to use available version (bitnine/agensgraph:latest)
2. Fixed Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS plugin configuration (@tailwindcss/postcss)
3. Added .dockerignore files to exclude node_modules from Docker build context
4. Fixed TypeScript build process in API Dockerfile with proper clean/build steps
5. Added healthchecks and service dependencies to ensure proper startup order
6. Used wget for healthcheck instead of curl (available in alpine containers)

## Lessons

### User-Specified Lessons
- Include useful debugging info in program output
- Read files before editing them  
- Run `npm audit` if there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal
- Always ask before using the `-force` git command

### Project-Specific Lessons
- **Docker Image Availability**: Always verify Docker images exist and are accessible before using them in docker-compose.yml. Use `docker search` and `docker pull` to test availability
- **Tailwind CSS v4 Changes**: PostCSS plugin moved to separate package @tailwindcss/postcss, update configuration accordingly
- **Docker Build Context**: Always add .dockerignore files to exclude node_modules and other large directories from build context to prevent build failures
- **TypeScript Build in Docker**: Ensure TypeScript compilation runs successfully in Docker by adding clean step and proper error handling
- **Service Dependencies**: Use healthchecks and depends_on with conditions to ensure services start in correct order and avoid networking issues
- **Alpine Linux Tools**: Use wget instead of curl for healthchecks in Alpine-based containers as it's more commonly available
